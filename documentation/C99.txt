C99

Sometimes C99 standard are going to be a real headache for developers since it 
can be provided in the different manner for each compiler. Therefore BBOS 
provides own version of the standard just to avoid such sort of situactions.

The headers can be found in include/bbos/lib/ folder. Currently supported 
standard headers:

	  stddef.h
	  stdbool.h
	  stdint.h

C99 and Compilers

To intoduce C99 header files each compiler may use a special form of definition
such as COMPILER_HAS_XXX. Examples:

  #define COMPILER_HAS_STDDEF_H
  #define COMPILER_HAS_STDBOOL_H
  #define COMPILER_HAS_STDINT_H
