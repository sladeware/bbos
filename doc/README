You must install pyserial to build this documentation. More information:
       http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial

Please run the following command in order to generate docs in html format:

       $ make html

Note that the results are under build/html. Also, the index.html there may not
contain all of the documentation and so you should keep digging around in the
subdirectories if you think more docs _might_ be found. No one will complain
if you fix this ;)
