# Vegimeter

The purpose of the Vegimeter application is to use the minimal amount
of energy to heat a container of potting soil to within a specific
temperature range, with the assumption that the ambient temperature is
below the desired range so that heating the soil is required. This is
to provide nearly ideal soil temperature to plants' roots so as to
optimize their nutrient transport.
