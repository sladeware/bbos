This is a high temperature (up to 105'C) FDA approval mini <FONT color=blue>submersible</FONT> water pump. The shaft is coated with a layer of ZrO2 (zirconium oxide ) for higher temperature handling and better tolerance for acid and alkaline. It's built by a brushless motor providing smooth and quiet operation than a non-brushless water pump. Plus,it will not generate 'electric spark' like what a brush type does so it's more safe. It can be used to pump oil as well (no gasoline*)
