WHAT IS BIONIC BUNNY?
=====================

Bionic Bunny (BB) is a platform for embedded systems development, providing
microkernel operating system-like functionality. It provides
language-independent, hardware-independent and network-transparent communication
for power efficient computing in heterogeneous microcontroller robotics
applications.

INSTALLING ON LINUX AND OTHER PLATFORMS
=======================================

First, of all, you need to install prerequisites, BB requires Python 2.5
or higher:

  $ sudo apt-get install make git python python-networkx

Next, download the latest version of BB platform (see http://bionicbunny.org)
to the place where it will live (e.g. /opt/bionicbunny/):

  $ git clone git@github.com:sladeware/bbos.git bionicbunny

Go to this directory and initiate configuration process:

  $ cd /opt/bionicbunny/
  $ ./configure

Once configuration was successfully done, run installation as root:

  $ sudo make install
