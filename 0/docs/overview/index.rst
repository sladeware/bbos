BBOS stands as **Bionic Bunny Operating System** and it is a small embedded 
operating system built from a set of reusable 
components that are assembled into an application specific system.

Simplicity and elegance are paramount in the design of BBOS operating system. A
very important design criterion is that every line of code is design for minimal 
power consumption. This is necessary given the nature of the intended 
applications, which typical do not permit "grid" connected power and instead 
rely on minimal power sources such as batteries or even super capacitors.
