What is Bionic Bunny?
---------------------

Bionic Bunny (BB) is a platform for embedded systems development, providing
microkernel operating system-like functionality. It provides
language-independent, hardware-independent and network-transparent communication
for power efficient computing in heterogeneous microcontroller robotics
applications.

   <http://www.bionicbunny.org>) to the place where it will live
   (e.g. `/opt/bbos/`):

        $ git clone git@github.com:sladeware/bbos.git

2. Go to this directory and initiate setup process:

        $ python setup.py
