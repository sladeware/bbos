 * @brief Simple segregated storage dynamic memory allocator
 *
 * With simple segregated storage, the free list for each size class contains 
 * same-sized blocks, each the size of the largest element of the size class. 
 * For example, if some size class is defined as {17 â€“ 32}, then the free list 
 * for that class consists entirely of blocks of size 32. 
 *
 * To allocate a block of some given size, we check the appropriate free list. 
 * If the list is not empty, we simply allocate the first block in its entirety.
 * Free blocks are never split to satisfy allocation requests. If the list is 
 * empty, the allocator returns NULL. To free a block, the allocator simply 
 * inserts the block at the front of the appropriate free list.
